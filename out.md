## User Story Tasks: View Blog

Here's a breakdown of tasks to implement the "view blog" user story, keeping the provided team standards in mind:

**Core Package Tasks:**

*   **Task:** Define `Blog` domain model in `core/models/blog.py`.
    *   **Details:** Create a `dataclass` or Pydantic model representing a blog post with attributes like `id` (int, optional), `title` (str), `author` (str), `date` (datetime), and `content` (str).  Include validation where appropriate.
*   **Task:** Define `BlogRepository` interface in `core/interfaces/blog_repository.py`.
    *   **Details:**  Create a `Protocol` defining methods for retrieving blog posts:  `get_all()` (returning a list of `Blog` objects), `get_by_id(blog_id: int)` (returning a `Blog` object or `None`).
*   **Task:** Define `BlogService` in `core/services/blog_service.py`.
    *   **Details:** Create a class `BlogService` that takes a `BlogRepository` instance as a dependency in its constructor. Implement methods like `list_posts()` (returning a `Result[List[Blog]]` of all posts in reverse chronological order) and `get_post(blog_id: int)` (returning a `Result[Blog]`). The `BlogService` handles the business logic, such as sorting the posts by date.
*   **Task:** Define `BlogPostDto` in `core/schemas/blog_schemas.py`.
    *   **Details:** Create a Pydantic model representing the data transfer object for a blog post. This might be a simplified version of the `Blog` model for API responses.
*   **Task:** Unit test `BlogService` in `tests/core/test_blog_service.py`.
    *   **Details:**  Write pytest unit tests for `BlogService` methods. Use mocks for `BlogRepository`.  Test cases should include: successful retrieval of posts, handling of errors from the repository, correct sorting of posts.  Follow the AAA pattern.

**Infrastructure Package Tasks:**

*   **Task:** Define `BlogModel` (SQLAlchemy model) in `infrastructure/database/models.py`.
    *   **Details:**  Create a SQLAlchemy model representing the `blogs` table with appropriate columns: `id` (Integer, primary key), `title` (String), `author` (String), `date` (DateTime), and `content` (Text). Implement `to_domain()` and `from_domain()` methods to convert between the SQLAlchemy model and the `Blog` domain model.
*   **Task:** Implement `SqlAlchemyBlogRepository` in `infrastructure/repositories/blog_repository.py`.
    *   **Details:** Create a class `SqlAlchemyBlogRepository` that implements the `BlogRepository` protocol. Use SQLAlchemy to interact with the database and retrieve blog posts. Implement the methods defined in the `BlogRepository` interface, including error handling.
*   **Task:** Write Alembic migration script to create the `blogs` table.
    *   **Details:** Create an Alembic migration script to create the `blogs` table in the database, ensuring the correct schema is defined.
*   **Task:** Integration test `SqlAlchemyBlogRepository` in `tests/infrastructure/test_blog_repository.py`.
    *   **Details:** Write pytest integration tests for `SqlAlchemyBlogRepository` methods, using a test database. Test cases should include: successful retrieval of posts, handling of errors, proper database interaction.

**Web Framework (FastAPI/Flask) Tasks:**

*   **Task:** Create API endpoint for listing blog posts.
    *   **Details:** Create a GET endpoint (e.g., `/blogs`) that uses the `BlogService` to retrieve all blog posts. Serialize the `Blog` objects using the `BlogPostDto` and return them as a JSON response.  Handle errors from the `BlogService` and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
*   **Task:** Create API endpoint for retrieving a single blog post by ID.
    *   **Details:** Create a GET endpoint (e.g., `/blogs/{blog_id}`) that uses the `BlogService` to retrieve a single blog post by its ID. Serialize the `Blog` object using the `BlogPostDto` and return it as a JSON response. Handle cases where the post is not found and return a 404 error.
*   **Task:** Implement dependency injection for `BlogService`.
    *   **Details:**  Configure FastAPI's dependency injection system to provide an instance of `BlogService` to the API endpoints, injecting the `SqlAlchemyBlogRepository`. This might involve creating a `get_blog_service` function in a `dependencies.py` file.
*   **Task:** Write API endpoint tests using `TestClient`.
    *   **Details:** Write pytest integration tests that use the FastAPI `TestClient` to test the API endpoints.  Test cases should include: successful retrieval of posts, handling of errors, correct status codes and JSON responses.

**General Tasks:**

*   **Task:** Set up database connection and session management.
    *   **Details:**  Configure SQLAlchemy to connect to the database. Implement a function to create and manage database sessions, using FastAPI's dependency injection to provide sessions to the repository.
*   **Task:** Implement error handling and logging.
    *   **Details:**  Add logging to the application to track errors and important events. Implement proper error handling to catch exceptions and return informative error messages to the client.

**Task Prioritization:**

The tasks should be implemented roughly in the order they are listed, starting with the Core package tasks to define the domain model and business logic, then moving to the Infrastructure package tasks to implement the data access layer, and finally to the Web Framework tasks to create the API endpoints. Unit tests should be written concurrently with the business logic.

    *   Set up a test database (e.g., SQLite in-memory) with sample blog posts.
    *   Verify that the `search_posts` method correctly retrieves matching posts from the database.
    *   Test different search keywords and ensure the correct results are returned.

*   **Task 8: API Endpoint Testing (Presentation)**

    *   Use `TestClient` (FastAPI) or similar tools (Flask) to test the `/blog/search` API endpoint.
    *   Send requests with different search keywords and verify the responses.
    *   Test error handling scenarios (e.g., invalid keyword, service error).

*   **Task 9: Code Review and Refactoring**

    *   Perform a thorough code review, ensuring adherence to team standards.
    *   Refactor the code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.

*   **Task 10: Documentation**
