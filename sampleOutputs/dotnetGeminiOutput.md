        *   Unit tests cover successful and failed removal scenarios.

*   **Task 4: Implement Comment Removal in Blazor Server UI**

    *   **Details:** Create UI elements for removing inappropriate comments from each post. Implement event handlers in the component that call the `RemoveCommentAsync` method in the `IAdminService` through the `AdminService`. Ensure proper state management and UI updates after comment removal.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   UI element for removing a comment is implemented (e.g., a "Remove" button).
        *   Clicking the "Remove" button calls the `RemoveCommentAsync` method.
        *   The UI reflects the comment removal immediately.
        *   Handle loading and error states appropriately.

*   **Task 5: Implement Dashboard for Published Posts and User Interactions**

    *   **Details:** Create a new Blazor component representing the dashboard. Fetch published posts and relevant user interaction data (e.g., likes, comments) via services. Display the data in a clear and organized format. Use dependency injection to access the necessary services.  Consider implementing pagination or filtering.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Dashboard component is created.
        *   Published posts and user interaction data are displayed.
        *   The dashboard is visually appealing and easy to navigate.
        *   The dashboard performance is acceptable.

*   **Task 6: Unit Tests for Admin Service**
    *   **Details**: Create a test project to test all the methods in `AdminService`. Should use mocking for `IPostRepository` and `ICommentRepository`.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria**:
        *   `AdminService` is thoroughly unit tested.

*   **Task 7: Integration Tests**
    *   **Details**: Create integration tests to test database operations of the Admin service.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria**:
        *   Create/Update/Delete operations are tested.
